# Drone
Drone, a simple game made via the Python, Kivy library where the player is a drone and has to fight 3 enemies in each "round".

The game is on an endless rounds cycle where hthe player's goal is to survive for as long as possible, collecting balloons and defeating "enemies". When a player loses all of his health, the game stops, indicating that the game is over. The balloons are the player's "score", the only real goal so far is beating your own high score.

The game is far from the "currently desired" state of being.
